  title: Sepsis — A Disease of Host Response
  description: 'In sepsis, controlled host immune response mechanisms become dysregulated,
    leading to collateral damage to blood vessels and major organs, such as the kidneys.
    This dysregulation manifests as structural shifts in white blood cells, which
    we can detect at the single cell level before organ dysfunction sets in, allowing
    for early diagnosis and intervention. '
