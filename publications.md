- title: Rapid Biophysical Analysis of Host Immune Cell Variations Associated with
    Sepsis
  subtitle: American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine
  abstract: This correspondence provides an overview of how our automated deformability
    cytometry instrument and microﬂuidic cartridge is used to measured shifts in the
    biomechanical  properties of immune cells, speciﬁcally activated neutrophils,
    in patients with sepsis.

- title: Quantitative Diagnosis of Malignant Pleural Effusions by Single-Cell Mechanophenotyping
  subtitle: 'Science Translational Medicine '
  abstract: |-
    In this paper, we conducted the first large scale clinical study evaluating the use of cellular mechanical biomarkers from thousands of single-cells as a diagnostic.  The report provides evidence that the approach could reduce the need for diagnostic procedures associated with body fluid cytological analysis and the associated costs while improving accuracy over currently used methods. In a highlight article, Guck et al. describe the impact of our work “…this study marks a quantum leap in the clinical application of mechanical phenotyping… Tse and colleagues have opened a door to merging mechanics with medicine; now, it is well worth stepping through to explore what lies behind.”
    <br><br>
    The clinical study focused on pleural fluid samples from more than 100 patients in which we aimed to identify patients with malignant cells using our high-throughput mechanical phenotyping approach. Current screening of pleural fluid for cancer is costly, time-consuming, and often inconclusive. The detailed biophysical metrics we obtained from profiles of many single cells, along with machine learning approaches, allowed improved sensitivity over traditional cytology.  Some patient samples that were not identified as cancerous via traditional methods were found to be so through deformability cytometry, and these results were verified six months later. Because our approach does not require a trained pathologist, its potential benefits are even greater in areas where there is a lack of such specialists, such as rural areas or developing nations.

- title: Hydrodynamic stretching of single cells for large population mechanical phenotyping
  subtitle: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
  abstract: "This work is the first to introduce the concept of measuring mechanical
    properties of cells at rates similar to flow cytometry (>1,000 cells/sec), enabling
    statistically robust conclusions and sub-population analyses. The deformability
    cytometer that we describe in the paper consists of a miniaturized microfluidic
    chip that sequentially aligns cells so that they impact on a wall of fluid at
    rates of thousands per second.  A high-speed camera takes microscopic images of
    these cells at higher intervals of 250,000 pictures per second, and these images
    are automatically analyzed by custom software to extract information about cell
    physical properties.  This approach provides a rapid and unambiguous integrative
    measure of the viscoelastic properties of cells. Viscous and elastic properties
    of cells are related to the membrane surrounding the cell, internal cytoskeletal
    structural elements, and the packed DNA arrangement in the nucleus.  Variations
    in these properties can be indicative of disease such as sepsis or cancer. \n<br><br>\nUsing
    this platform data indicating the ability to identify inflammation, malignant
    cell populations and other cell states without costly chemical tags is reported,
    supporting diagnostic application areas where rapid analysis of the mechanical
    response of cells is important. While previous researchers have shown the relevance
    of the physical properties of cells to their health, the speed of our technique
    allows these findings to be clinically relevant."

- title: A Mechanical Biomarker of Cell State in Medicine
  subtitle: JALA
  abstract: This review highlights the opportunities to improve clinical diagnostics
    using mechanical measurements of populations of single-cells as unique biomarkers.
    These biomarkers are argued to that have some advantages over molecular markers
    which require labeling and sample preparation, which can increase the complexity
    and cost of an assay. The manuscript highlights the body of historical work using
    slow, manual, and complex techniques (e.g. AFM, micropipette aspiration, and optical
    stretching) to measure the mechanical stiffness of cells and connect these metrics
    to changes in cell state and disease. The work also poses that throughput and
    robust quantitative instrumentation similar to flow cytometry will be necessary
    to achieve an impact in medicine using these historically established biomarkers.
    Clinical and drug discovery application areas from immunology, oncology, and regenerative
    medicine, are covered where a rapid mechanical measurement may have significant
    value. Finally, the technological advances needed to achieve rapid and robust
    measurements are reviewed.
