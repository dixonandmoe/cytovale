  title: Cell Measurement Comparison
  subtitle: The main issue to date has been <em>throughput</em>
  description: Until deformability cytometry, most techniques could only measure tens
    of cells per hour, limiting throughput and rendering the technique too cumbersome
    for clinical diagnostic applications or high throughput research applications.
    An overview of these techniques has been modified from this review
  results_title: Comparison Results
  results_description: CytoVale can measure <strong>2,000 cells per second</strong>,
    unlocking the potential to utilize biomechanical markers as a relevant clinical
    diagnostic technique across broad diagnostic indications

  - title: Diagnostic
    description: A fluid sample containing the diagnostic cells of interest is collected
      from patients where diagnostic uncertainty exists.

  - title: Fluid Sample
    description: A fluid sample containing the diagnostic cells of interest is collected
      from patients where diagnostic uncertainty exists.
    image: "/uploads/tech-02-sample.png"
  - title: Cartridge Preparation
    description: The fluid sample is processed and loaded on a single use, disposable
      plastic cartridge with specific microfluidic paths responsible for assessing
      the biomechanical properties of single cells.
    image: "/uploads/tech-03-cartridge.png"
  - title: Processing
    description: The loaded cartridge is inserted in a benchtop instrument containing
      a “deconstructed microscope” and high speed￼￼videography capable of capturing
      over 500,000 frames per second of images. The instrument actuates pressure driven
      flow within the cartridge and captures information.

  - title: Cellular Squeeze
    description: Within the microfluidic channels of the cartridge under pressure
      driven flow, cells are lined up into the center streamline in one branch of
      an intersection. A wall of opposing fluid is pushed from the opposite side (think
      of two fire hydrants pointed at each other), which squeeze the cell within the
      intersection. The resulting images are captured with high speed videography
      .

  - title: Metrics and Analytics
    description: "￼Image analysis captures dozens of metrics for each cell, including
      morphology metrics prior to squeezing (e.g., cell diameter or surface roughness),
      molecular metrics from fluorescent cell surface label probes (e.g., CD45+),
      and structural metrics (e.g., maximum cellular deformability) during the squeezing
      event."

  - title: Disease Signature Graphs
    description: "￼Disease signatures are constructed either in 2 dimensions (e.g.,
      plot of initial cell diameter vs. deformability) or multiple dimensions that
      have been reduced by machine learning techniques, such as Principle Component
      Analysis"

  - title: Diagnostic Check
    description: "￼The diagnostic disease signature enables a better lens into the
      disease state of patients, enabling appropriate and timely care and reducing
      morbidity, mortality, and cost."
