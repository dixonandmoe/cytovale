  title: 'Biomechanical Properties of Single Cells '
  subtitle: "(e.g., cellular deformability, or cellular viscosity)"
  description: indicate changes in the global state of cells, including phenomena
    such as
  changes:
  - title: Proliferation
    description: Highly replicative cancer cells are significantly more deformable
      than their non-cancerous, benign, precursors.

  - title: Activation
    description: Immune activation may be readily distinguished from baseline biomechanical
      signatures, and chronic vs. acute inflammation states have notable differences.

  - title: Differentiation
    description: Pluripotent stem cells become less deformable as they commit to a
      lineage and differentiate.

  - title: Migration
    description: Metastatic cancer cells are notably more deformable than those with
      reduced metastatic potential.

  title: Comparison of Leading Techniques to Assess Cell Mechanics
  subtitle: The main issue to date has been <em>throughput</em>
  description: "The main issue to date has been throughput; \ngenerating meaningful
    diagnostic information requires the analysis of thousands of cells. Until deformability
    cytometry, most techniques could only measure tens of cells per hour, rendering
    the approach too cumbersome for clinical diagnostic applications or high throughput
    research applications. "

  results_description: CytoVale can measure <strong>2,000 cells per second</strong>,
    unlocking the potential to utilize biomechanical markers as a relevant clinical
    diagnostic technique across broad diagnostic indications

  system:
  - title: Patient
    description: Diagnostic uncertainty means optimal treatment course is unknown.
    image: "/uploads/tech-01-diagnostic.png"
  - title: Fluid Sample
    description: A fluid sample containing the diagnostic cells of interest is collected
      from the patient.
    image: "/uploads/tech-02-sample.png"
  - title: Cartridge Preparation
    description: The sample is loaded on a single-use, microfluidic cartridge with
      proprietary features for assessing the biomechanical properties of single cells.
    image: "/uploads/tech-03-cartridge.png"
  - title: Processing
    description: The cartridge is inserted into a benchtop instrument containing a
      “deconstructed microscope” that actuates precision flow and captures high speed
      videography data at over 500,000 image frames per second.
    image: "/uploads/tech-04-processing.png"
  - title: Cellular Squeeze
    description: Under flow, precision microfluidic features apply carefully calibrated
      forces to the cells, and the resulting deformation is captured with high speed
      videography.
    image: "/uploads/tech-05-squeeze.png"
  - title: Metrics and Analytics
    description: "￼Image analysis captures dozens of metrics for each cell, including
      morphology metrics prior to squeezing (e.g., cell diameter or surface roughness),
      molecular metrics from fluorescent cell surface probes (e.g., CD45+), and structural
      metrics (e.g., maximum cellular deformability) during the squeezing event."

  - title: Disease Signature
    description: Robust disease signatures are constructed across multiple dimensions
      and are reduced by machine learning techniques.  Each patient's unique signature
      is compared to established profiles to determine a diagnostic score.
    image: "/uploads/tech-07-graph.png"
  - title: Diagnostic Result
    description: "￼The diagnostic score is reported to the clinician and provides
      a better lens into the disease state of the patient, enabling appropriate and
      timely care and reducing morbidity, mortality, and cost."
