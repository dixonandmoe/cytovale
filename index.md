  title: About Us
  description: 'We’re a team of biologists, data scientists, and engineers developing
    mechanical biomarkers to improve human health. Our novel microfluidic platform
    allows us to probe individual cells to quantify the mechanicals signatures of
    disease. We are applying this first to sepsis, a condition whose early detection
    dramatically improves patient outcomes and reduces treatment cost.<br><br>Reflecting
    our technology/biology hybrid company, at our San Francisco office the data team
    sits across from a wet lab, and our biologists handle python as well as pipettes.
    We believe close collaboration helps us move fast to bring health insights to
    patients and their healthcare providers. '

  description: 'We’ve enrolled a multi-hundred patient clinical study in support of
    our flagship product in early sepsis detection in the emergency department, which
    has the potential to significantly reduce morbidity and mortality, decrease healthcare
    costs, and satisfy a $1B+ diagnostic market. We are also demonstrating our platform’s
    potential in several additional applications. '

  subtitle: The Cytovale System
  description: 'Three decades of work in labs spanning the globe tell us that the
    biomechanical properties cells are intimately linked with cell state. Until deformability
    cytometry, most techniques could only measure tens of cells per hour—not enough
    to produce a clinically relevant dataset at reasonable time and cost. The speed
    of Cytovale’s microfluidic platform brings these illuminating biomarkers from
    the university lab to the hospital, patients, and their caregivers. '
