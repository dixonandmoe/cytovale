  title: About Us
  description: 'We’re a team of biologists, data scientists, and engineers developing
    mechanical biomarkers to improve human health. Our novel microfluidic platform
    allows us to probe individual cells to quantify the mechanical signatures of disease.
    We are applying this first to sepsis, a condition whose early detection dramatically
    improves patient outcomes and reduces treatment cost.<br><br>Reflecting our technology/biology
    hybrid company, at our San Francisco office the data team sits across from a wet
    lab, and our biologists handle python as well as pipettes. We believe close collaboration
    helps us move fast to bring health insights to patients and their healthcare providers. '

  description: 'We’ve enrolled a multi-hundred patient clinical study in support of
    our flagship product in early sepsis detection in the emergency department, which
    has the potential to significantly reduce morbidity and mortality, decrease healthcare
    costs, and satisfy a $1B+ diagnostic market. We are also demonstrating our platform’s
    potential in several additional applications. '

  subtitle: The Cytovale System
  description: 'Three decades of work in labs spanning the globe tell us that the
    biomechanical properties of cells are intimately linked with cell state. Until
    deformability cytometry, most techniques could only measure tens of cells per
    hour—not enough to produce a clinically relevant dataset at reasonable time and
    cost. The speed of Cytovale’s microfluidic platform brings these illuminating
    biomarkers from the university lab to the hospital, patients and their caregivers. '
